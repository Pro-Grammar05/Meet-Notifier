A cool program to remind you about meetings with a desktop notification. 

In the **timings** list, you can input the start times of your meetings. (Use 24 hour format)

In line 11, the duration parameter is the number of seconds until you want your next notification to come.

Get the win10toast module using pip

P.S The icon for your notif should have the **.ico** format
